[ML FizzBuzz test](MLClassificationREADME.md).
- Data generation: Write a program that given the numbers from 1 to 100 print “None” for each number. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of “None” and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

**Requirements:**
- Train any classification algorithm (E.g. support vector machine ) to solve the test as a classic supervised classification problem with four classes
- Build your own dataset of any length, any preprocessing step in the input data is allowed
- Also, provide the accuracy score obtained by the model with the test data (numbers from 1 - 100)
- Provide a brief theoretical description of the designed model and data pipeline
- Share the implementation and documentation of the project using GitHub

**Extra Points:**
- Perform a ten folds cross-validation using different classification algorithms and select the best among them
- Update the documentation to support the selection (or not) of a new algorithm
- Publish the trained model as a web service
- Create unit tests for the implementation with a test coverage >=80%

*The required theoretical description should be put with the other files from the project, could be in the README or other documentation format.*
